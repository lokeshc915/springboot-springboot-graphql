2 ) Check if all maven dependencies are installed by using this code  mvn clean install 

3 ) Add all relevant graphql dependencies in pom.xml

4 ) Define a query endpoint URL in the GraphiQL (http://localhost:8081/graphql)

5 ) Run the GraphiQL after defining queries with its variable in its essential parts of the program
